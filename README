## Installation
### Prerequisites
The libGNME package requires a set of standard libraries:
1. LAPACK, BLAS or Intel MKL
2. OpenMP
3. CMake (version 3.12 or higher)

### Compilation
The configure script can be run depending on the choice of compiler:
    ./configure [intel/gcc/pgi]
    cd build
    make install

Following installation, the test suite can be executed from the ./build/ directory by running 
    ctest -j NPROC
